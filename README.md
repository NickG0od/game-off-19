Game project for jam in itch.io "Game Off 2019"

[ HISTORY ]

I present to you my first game "CubeH", sure that not the last. 
This work has been done for more than one month, more than one year. 
There was the first version of a game with a similar mechanics, but quite a terrible design two years ago 
(At that time I was still studying the Construct2 engine ^_^). 
After a while, I decided to study the basics of the Unity engine and write the game.
By lowering a long story about its difficulties during the whole development period, I can say that during the last month
the project was completely updated to the current state. It took a lot of time to optimize the mechanics, 
to select music and to create an attractive visual design.
... why all this? It may sound banal, but this game has a soul, and it is not my words. I will be 
glad to write your opinion. Just I WISH WAKE.
